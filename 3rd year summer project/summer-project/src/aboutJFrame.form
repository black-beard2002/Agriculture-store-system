A planet so covered with aquaculture, plantations, rangelands, farms, villages, and cities that wild creatures and wild places, if they still exist at all, linger only at the &#xa;margins of working landscapes, cityscapes, and seascapes.Is this the planet you want to live on? No matter who you are, I bet it&#x2019;s not. Your ideal planet would sustain both people and nature, &#xa;leaving plenty of room for wild creatures to live and thrive in habitats free of human interference.&#xa;&#xa;Why think about this? The answer is simple. If you aspire to live on a planet where wild creatures roam unhindered across wild landscapes, this is not the planet you are making. While times have likely &#xa;never been better for most people, the opposite is true for the rest of life on Earth.Less than one-quarter of Earth&#x2019;s land remains without human populations or land use.2 Wild species, especially wild &#xa;animals, are going extinct faster than they can be counted. The cause is mostly habitat conversion and loss, combined with unregulated hunting and resource use, pollution, competition with species &#xa;transported from other parts of the world, and increasingly, global changes in climate.The case has been made many, many times that transforming the planet in this way is ecologically, economically, &#xa;and ethically unsustainable.4 These claims and their supporting evidence are important. Yet facts and rational arguments are not nearly enough to change the way things are going.To sustain Earths &#xa;wild places and wild species into the deep future, an unprecedented level of social change will be required. The good news is that the roots of this great social transition are already evolving. &#xa;By engaging with these evolutionary processes of sociocultural change, human societies might ultimately produce and sustain a far better world than the one we are creating now.&#xa;&#xa;This planet is the way it is because our societies made it that way. There is no control room on Earth. No one is in charge of the planet. And no one is intentionally destroying nature. People transform &#xa;ecology to make a living. We humans, as individuals and societies, are shaping this planet while we are busy making other plans. Planetary change is social change, and contemporary societies are &#xa;transforming the world at rates and scales unprecedented for any other species in Earth&#x2019;s history.5 Such is the nature of the Anthropocene.&#xa;&#xa;Human transformation of Earth is nothing new. As Earth&#x2019;s &#x201c;ultimate ecosystem engineers,&#x201d; humans have always transformed environments to sustain themselves, using ever more complex tools,&#xa;from fire and social strategies for hunting and foraging to domesticating species, grazing livestock, tilling soils, and building global supply chains to service urban supermarkets.Since our species began &#xa;to spread across the continents more than 60,000 years ago, human societies have grown in scale from a few dozen individuals to hundreds of millions. Through processes of cooperative ecosystem &#xa;engineering, the potential productivity of a single square kilometer of land has gone from sustaining fewer than ten individuals supported by foraging and hunting to sustaining thousands through &#xa;intensive agricultural practices. Energy use per individual has also scaled up by a factor of more than 20, from the burning of biomass to cook food to the use of fossil fuels and nonbiological energy &#xa;sources (like solar, wind, and nuclear) to do our work. This energy now powers the flow of materials, energy, biota, and information across the globe, and human societies, as a result, have emerged as &#xa;a force of nature.These unmatched capacities to shape Earth&#x2019;s functioning are based on socially learned and socially enacted behaviors. Unlike beavers, ants, and other species whose abilities to alter &#xa;environments by building dams and nests are biological, humans must learn from others how to hunt, farm, trade stocks, or even live together. Humans are ultrasocial &#x2014; the most social species that &#xa;has ever existed on Earth, unable to survive or to reproduce without learning how to live from and with others.7 It takes a social group, a village, a nation-state, or a global trading system for humans &#xa;to make a living, or to transform an environment. And it takes social learning &#x2014; culture &#x2014; to make it all possible. Through millennia of social change and cultural evolution, human societies have &#xa;accumulated cultural capacities that have enabled us to become very good at making Earth&#x2019;s ecology work for us.&#xa;&#xa;What will be our legacy? It is hard to imagine a greater gift to the future than a planet as richly diverse or richer than the one that evolved in the millions of years before our common ancestors first &#xa;walked the plains of Africa.&#xa;"/>
